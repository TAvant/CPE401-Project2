I created this program using an iPython notebook. In order to run the program 
you will need to install iPython notebook on your machine then navagate to 
the directory with the .ipynb file (via your terminal) and enter: 

	ipython notebook

If you do not want to install the iPython notebook and just want to review my results, please see the file 'traceroutes.html'

The program has been well documented throughout the notebook 'planetlab.ipynb,'
so I won't go over ever detail in the README, please review the notebook if 
you have any questions as to the details of the implementation.

In addition to the iPython notebook you will find the file 'traceroute.py' this
is the program that was deployed to all of the nodes and is what executed the 
traceroute on each of the Planet-Lab nodes and stored the traces into their 
respective files at each node.

You'll find a dirctory named 'data' in which there are two files for the 
nodes: 'nodes.txt' and 'clean-nodes.txt' I copied the nodes associeated with 
my slice from Planet Lab's website and stored them in the file 'nodes.txt' 
I then needed to clean them up before using this data, this is what you will 
find in 'clean-nodes.txt' Last you will find 'traceroutes.csv' This file 
sontains all of the pertinent information extracted from each of the traces. 

The directory 'traceroutes' holds all of the traces, from the nodes, for both 
google.com and akamai.com The filename format is as such:

	nodename-url.txt
